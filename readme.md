## What is it?

Hunt the Wumpus is an artificial intelligence browser-based game, where the goal is for the player to find the gold.

The player must navigate rooms within the dungeon, while perceiving senses from each room. Each sense reveals a hint of what is in an adjacent room. The following objects exist in the dungeon.

Hunt the Wumpus offers a simple environment to demonstrate symbolic and logical-based artificial intelligence AI algorithms, including predicate logic, first-order logic, search algorithms, and intelligent computer navigation within a deterministic, discrete, partially obserable world.

## Game Objects

The following objects exist within the dungeon.

### Objects

- Pit: If the player enters a room with a pit, the game is over.
- Wumpus: If the player enters a room with a wumpus, the game is over.
- Gold: If the player enters a room with the gold, the player wins and the game is over.

### Senses

When the player enters a room with an adjacent room containing an item, they will be given a hint as a perceived sense. Senses are available for directly adjacent rooms, no diagonals.

- Breeze: A pit is nearby.
- Stench: A wumpus is nearby.
- Glitter: The gold is nearby.
